1. The variables that provided a non-random amount of variance to the mgp values in the dataset are vehicle weight, spoiler angle and AWD. 
2. The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero based on the p-value of 5.35 e-11.
3. Our r-squared value is 0.7149, which means that around 71% of the time, this model will accurately predict MPG figures. For that reason, this linear model does predict MPG of MechaCar prototypes effectively.
